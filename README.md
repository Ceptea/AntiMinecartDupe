# AntiMinecartDupe
## qna:

### what is this?
- it is a patch i wrote that prevents the basic minecart chest dupe (as seen here: <https://youtu.be/vbttUVUqIbU>)

### how does it work?
- read the code, it's pretty self explanatory

### can it be bypassed?
- most likely if the 'duper' uses a different method i don't know of, most of the people doing this on your server won't think that far most likely

```
this is built for poseidon, a beta 1.7.3 server software.
if you use the poseidon version thing that lets you make an older server while still using beta 1.7.3, the lowest i've tested it to is beta 1.1_02 and it still worked
